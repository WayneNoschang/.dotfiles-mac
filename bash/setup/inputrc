# Readline init config
#   Readline is a GNU standard library for handling command line editing.
#   Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization file (inputrc).  
#   Default file name is ~/.inputrc or a value from INPUTRC variable. The system default is /etc/inputrc.
#   Readline configuration can also be done in a .bashrc file using the 'bind' command (e.g. `bind '"\e[3~": delete-char'`).
#   When a program which uses the readline library starts up, inputrc is read and executed.
#   Search for 'READLINE' in bash man page or visit https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Readline-Init-File.html

#   There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the readline initialization file.  
#     Blank lines are ignored.
#     Lines beginning with a # are comments.
#     Lines beginning with a $ indicate conditional constructs.
#     Other lines denote key bindings and variable settings.

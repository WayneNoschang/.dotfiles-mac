# Dotfiles for macOS
Currently a work in progress...

## Goal
1. Provide configuration for a development environment that can be cloned from GitHub
2. Automate configuration as much as possible, provide info for what must be done manually
3. Configuration files should be neatly organized with relevant notes
4. Notes should provide code explanations, reminders, tips, and links to resources (e.g. curated lists, tutorials, docs and etc.)

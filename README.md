# Dotfiles for macOS
Currently a work in progress...

## Goal
1. Provide configuration for a development environment that can be cloned from GitHub
2. Automate configuration as much as possible, provide info for what must be done manually
3. Configuration files should be neatly organized each containing comprehensive and relevant notes.
4. Relevant notes include code explanation, reminders, tips, and links to resources (e.g. curated lists, tutorials, docs and etc.)

# NOTES

# cd -          # Change to previous directory.
# cd arg1 arg2  # Change directory using a search and replace string.

# Brace `{}` expansion is done before tilde `~` expansion in Zsh, the opposite in Bash.
# Compare output of echo ~{HOME,PWD} between Zsh and Bash.

# Named directories:
# dirname=absolute/path/of/directory  # Create a "named directory".
# ~dirname                            # Expands to directory path of dirname.


# The directory stack (dirstack) is a list of recently visited directories. 
# The current directory is always at the "top" of the directory stack.
# dirs -v  # Display directory stack as a numbered list. 
# pushd    # Change current directory and add previous to top of stack.
# popd     # Remove top directory from stack and make current directory.
# ~-n      # Expands to directory number `n` from bottom.
# cd +n    # Switch to directory number `n` from top.

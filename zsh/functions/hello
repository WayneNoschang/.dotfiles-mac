# Let's again assume that these are the contents of a file called "hello".

# You may run arbitrary code in here, that will run the first time the
# function is referenced. Commonly, that is initialisation code. For example
# the `_tmux' completion function does exactly that.
# echo initialising...
sleep 7s

# You may also define additional functions in here. Note, that these
# functions are visible in global scope, so it is paramount to take
# care when you're naming these so you do not shadow existing commands or
# redefine existing functions.
hello_helper_one () {
   printf 'Hello'
}

hello_helper_two () {
   printf 'world.'
}

# Now you should redefine the "hello" function (which currently contains
# all the code from the file) to something that covers its actual
# functionality. After that, the two helper functions along with the core
# function will be defined and visible in global scope.
hello () {
  sleep 5s
  printf '%s %s\n' "$(hello_helper_one)" "$(hello_helper_two)"
}

# Finally run the redefined function with the same arguments as the current
# run. If this is left out, the functionality implemented by the newly
# defined "hello" function is not executed upon its first call. So:
hello "$@"

# It's a good idea to put 'emulate -L zsh' at the top of your function file to avoid user configuration or parameter expansion.
